Multi-threaded search for filenames on remote machines, returning the root path if the file exists.

When ENTER is pressed, it opens a window with each tab pointing to the found root.

Reduced work time from 15 minutes to approximately 2 minutes.

This project is very specific for my own needs. (my current job)

TODO: Add clipboard pasting functionality to auto-replace input paths with the actual paths where files were found
